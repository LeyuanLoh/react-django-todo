I made this project while following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5OUT3ijk8M&t=3812s&ab_channel=BekBrace
His code for this project also can be found at https://github.com/BekBrace/django-react-app-Task_Manager. There are a little bit of slight differences between his github and youtube version in term on UI.

Pre-req 
- Python 3.xx.
- pipenv (Great tool to create virtual environment. To install just do "pip install pipenv".)

1. Cd into backend folder and start virtual environment.
Do "pipenv shell".

2. Install django.
Do "pipenv install django".

3. Install restframework and cors headers.
Do "pipenv install djangorestframework django-cors-headers".

4. Run backend server.
Do "python manage.py runserver". Please note that django is full backend here. 


Things I am planning to implement:
- Multipage application
- Deployment of this application to linux web server.
- Graph
